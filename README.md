# Pancake Swap
**An Autonomous Market Maker (AMM) on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**

## Overview and Origin
Pancake Swap (PCS) is a decentralised exchange and AMM protocol deployed on the BSC on September 2020<sup>1</sup>. Many of its core functionalities mirror UniSwap, the original AMM launched back in September 2018 on the Ethereum blockchain, which paved the way to a new generation of trading<sup>2</sup>. 

Although the founders of PCS are anonymous, their smart contracts have been audited by Certik, a blockchain seucrity firm based in New York and PCS consistently ranks number 1 in Certik's Security Leaderboard<sup>3</sup>. 

Since most of the code and technology required to launch PCS already existed on the Ethereum blockchain, the team did not need any initial funding to start the project<sup>1</sup>. Once their smart contracts for their AMM was deployed, PCS utilised a "[fair launch](#1)" to distribute their tokens to the community through "[yield farming](#2)" and "[staking](3)"<sup>1</sup>. 

Lastly, the development team currently burns 100% of all tokens allocated to the developer's wallet, as a way to minimise inflation and preserve token value<sup>4</sup>. The PCS team's only income would be their personal investment in the token (which has appreciated over 1900% since launch and over 10000% since their all time low<sup>5</sup>) plus 0.03% of trading fees allocated to the Treasury, which is controlled by the PCS team<sup>4</sup>. 

## Introduction to AMMs

The original aim of AMMs in general were to create a platform where users can trade between each other without the need of a trusted intermediary, thus creating a decentralised platform where funds can be secured in escrow by a verified smart contract. 

Users are typically incentivised to commit their funds to "liquidity pools" through "yield farming" and fee sharing mechanisms, but liquidity providers will suffer "impermanent loss" when there are large swings in prices. 

 However, due to the rise in popularity of AMMs and decentralised finance (DeFi) in general, the Ethereum network was congested and had major scaling issues. After experiencing these issues first hand by paying over $100 USD in gas fees for my trades to be executed in a timely manner, even before any of the trade fees were accounted for, it was clear these platforms were unsustainable for the average user and a new network with lower fees was required. 

## PCS Business Activities
Although UniSwap's AMM had already solved for the problem of removing the middleman, PCS now solves the issue of prohibitively expensive network fees and slow block times on Ethereum [at the cost of true decentralisation](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/is-the-binance-smart-chain-centralized-messari-researchers-raise-concerns/). 

However, with the low barrier of entry to creating your own token on BSC and low network costs for traders, BSC entered a new era of scammers and thieves. 

Due to the decentralised nature of PCS, any developer could deploy their own token onto BSC and list it onto PCS to begin trading, aiming to pray on new traders and inexperienced traders. Subsequently, these traders would jump onto these new listings and buy new tokens that have no use case nor utility, which may appreciate drastically in value anyway (see [SafeMoon](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/safemoon/)), but the majority end up being scams or "[rugpulls](#5)". 

Despite the prevalence of scam coins being traded on PCS, BSC has grown exponentially from just 351,000 transactions per day at the start of 2021 to over 6,500,000 by the 15<sup>th</sup> of August 2021. 

# Glossary
<a name="1"></a> **Fair Launch**: a new token distribution method with no team allocation, no ICO and no presale. Users can earn the new token through actively participating in the protocols. 

<a name="4"></a> **Liquidity Pools (LPs)**: tokens provided by users that other traders can trade between. Traditionally, the LP will always contain 50% of each asset in the trading pair (though newer AMMs allow one-sided liquidity)

<a name="2"></a> **Yield Farming**: earning the native tokens of AMMs through providing liquidity to the liquidity pools as an added incentive


<a name="3"></a> **Staking**: committing tokens (often includes an unstaking period, but not always) to earn other tokens or more of the same token to increase utility of the base token

<a name="3"></a> **Rugpull**: a type of exit scam typically involving pulling out all liquidity from the LP (thus holders can no longer sell), or simply selling all of the team's token into the LP and depreciating the price significantly. [Here](https://www.cylynx.io/blog/the-rise-of-cryptocurrency-exit-scams-and-defi-rug-pulls/) is a more detailed explanation and a few famous examples.
