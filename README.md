# Pancake Swap
**An Autonomous Market Maker (AMM) on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**

## Overview and Origin
Pancake Swap (PCS) is a decentralised exchange and AMM protocol deployed on the BSC on September 2020<sup>1</sup>. Many of its core functionalities mirror UniSwap, the original AMM launched back in September 2018 on the Ethereum blockchain, which paved the way to a new generation of trading<sup>2</sup>. 

Although the founders of PCS are anonymous, their smart contracts have been audited by Certik, a blockchain seucrity firm based in New York and PCS consistently ranks number 1 in Certik's Security Leaderboard<sup>3</sup>. 

Since most of the code and technology required to launch PCS already existed on the Ethereum blockchain, the team did not need any initial funding to start the project<sup>1</sup>. Once their smart contracts for their AMM was deployed, PCS utilised a "[fair launch](#abcd)" to distribute their tokens to the community through "yield farming" and "staking"<sup>1</sup>. 

Lastly, the development team currently burns 100% of all tokens allocated to the developer's wallet, as a way to minimise inflation and preserve token value<sup>4</sup>. The PCS team's only income would be their personal investment in the token (which has appreciated over 1900% since launch and over 10000% since their all time low<sup>5</sup>) plus 0.03% of trading fees allocated to the Treasury, which is controlled by the PCS team<sup>4</sup>. 

## Introduction to AMMs

The original aim of AMMs in general were to create a platform where users can trade between each other without the need of a trusted intermediary, thus creating a decentralised platform where funds can be secured in escrow by a verified smart contract. 

Users are typically incentivised to commit their funds to "liquidity pools" through "yield farming" and fee sharing mechanisms, but liquidity providers will suffer "impermanent loss" when there are large swings in prices. 

 However, due to the rise in popularity of AMMs and decentralised finance (DeFi) in general, the Ethereum network was congested and had major scaling issues. After experiencing these issues first hand by paying over $100 USD in gas fees for my trades to be executed in a timely manner, even before any of the trade fees were accounted for, it was clear these platforms were unsustainable for the average user and a new network was required.
