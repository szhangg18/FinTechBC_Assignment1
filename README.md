**An Autonomous Market Maker (AMM) on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**

## **Overview and Origin**
Pancake Swap (PCS) is a decentralised exchange and autonomous market making (AMM) protocol deployed on the BSC on September 2020<sup>1</sup>. Many of its core functionalities mirror UniSwap, the original AMM launched back in September 2018 on the Ethereum blockchain, which paved the way to a new generation of trading<sup>2</sup>. 

Although the founders of PCS are anonymous, their smart contracts have been audited by Certik, a blockchain seucrity firm based in New York and PCS consistently ranks number 1 in Certik's Security Leaderboard<sup>3</sup>. 

Since most of the code and technology required to launch PCS already existed on the Ethereum blockchain, the team did not need any initial funding to start the project<sup>1</sup>. Once their smart contracts for their AMM was deployed, PCS utilised a "[fair launch](#1)" to distribute their tokens to the community through "[yield farming](#2)" and "[staking](#3)"<sup>1</sup>. 

Since the development team currently burns 100% of all tokens allocated to the developer's wallet (as a way to minimise inflation and preserve token value)<sup>4</sup>, the PCS team's only income would be their personal investment in the token (which has appreciated over 1900% since launch and over 10000% since their all time low<sup>5</sup>) plus the 0.03% trading fee allocated to the Treasury, which is controlled by the PCS team<sup>4</sup>. 

## **Introduction to AMMs**

The original aim of AMMs in general were to create a platform where users can trade between each other without the need of a trusted intermediary, thus creating a decentralised platform where funds can be secured in escrow by a verified smart contract. 

Users are typically incentivised to commit their funds to "[liquidity pools](#4)" through "[yield farming](#2)" and fee sharing mechanisms, but liquidity providers will suffer "impermanent loss" when there are large swings in prices. 

 However, due to the rise in popularity of AMMs and decentralised finance (DeFi) in general, the Ethereum network was congested and had major scaling issues. After experiencing these issues first hand by paying over $100 USD in gas fees for my trades to be executed in a timely manner, even before any of the trade fees were accounted for, it was clear these platforms were unsustainable for the average user and a new network with lower fees was required. 

 ### **Technology behind PCS**
As opposed to traditional order books, AMMs use liquidity pools where users may deposit their funds as liquidity into a smart contract. 

This smart contract holds the funds in escrow, allowing traders to trade between two pairs for a small fee, which is split between the liquidity providers and sometimes the AMM platform. 

## **PCS Business Activities**
Although UniSwap's AMM had already solved for the problem of removing the middleman, PCS now solves the issue of prohibitively expensive network fees and slow block times on Ethereum [at the cost of true decentralisation](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/is-the-binance-smart-chain-centralized-messari-researchers-raise-concerns/). 

However, with the low barrier of entry to creating your own token on BSC and low network costs for traders, **BSC entered a the golden age for scammers**. 

Due to the decentralised nature of PCS, any developer could deploy their own token onto BSC and list it onto PCS to begin trading, aiming to pray on new traders and inexperienced traders. Subsequently, these traders would jump onto these new listings and buy new tokens that have no use case nor utility, which may appreciate drastically in value anyway (see [SafeMoon](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/safemoon/)), but the majority end up being scams or "[rugpulls](#5)".

Despite the prevalence of scam coins being traded on PCS, the platform has still grown considerably and personally, I believe the sentiment is fast shifting away from get rich quick scam coins over to legitimate projects with real use-cases. 

### **PCS Business Metrics**

The platform currently has over $5 billion USD being locked in liquidity and consistently over $500 million USD daily trading volume on their AMMs. Given the 0.03% fee to the treasury, the platform is now generating over $150,000 USD per day in revenue for the team<sup>6</sup>.

PCS currently averages over 250,000 daily active users over the past week as of 16/08/2021<sup>7</sup>.

The spike in volume seen in May was due to high volatility seen in the crypto markets, with Bitcoin's price bouncing between the $35,000 and $45,000 USD range over the course of a couple days. Despite the volume falling substantially since the peak, it has retained a relatively stable market share compared to other BSC platforms. 

### **BSC Competitors to PCS**
Despite PCS being on BSC which boasts lower fees than Ethereum, PCS still had a lot of competition among other BSC AMMs. The most notable are "ApeSwap" and "BakerySwap", both launching their own AMMs to compete with PCS but neither have been able to surpass it. 

Other yield farming websites utilise the LPs of PCS but offer their own native coin as a yield farming incentive, these often pose as competitors to PCS but are ultimately bringing more liquidity to PCS, which greatly benefits PCS. One of the most notable examples of this is GooseDefi, who originally aimed to create their own AMM but has yet to achieve this goal. 

However, due to PCS's first mover's advantage, name recognition and connection with Binance and CZ, CEO of Binance, PCS has been able to remain the most used AMM on BSC. 

### **Off-Chain Competitors to PCS**
With the emergence of multiple new chains with faster processing speeds and cheaper fees than BSC such as FTM and MATIC, there are multiple new competitors entering the market. 

However, due to the difficulty with bridging funds between blockchains such as going from BSC to FTM, many of these newer blockchains are not yet utilised to its maximum potential. Once centralised exchanges allow the withdrawal of funds to these newer blockchains, or if bridges become faster, cheaper and capable of more liquidity, these newer blockchains may become more utilised, thus may become serious threats to PCS. Therefore, at this stage these cross chain AMMs are not a large threat to PCS but likely will become a large threat as they develop. 

## **Industry Innovations**
Although BSC is retaining a large market share in the AMM space, many of the most important AMM innovations are actually coming from Uniswap. 

As of May, Uniswap launched their V3 protocol, which boasts a huge range of added functionality. The most notable including concentrated liquidity, boosting capital efficiency and effectively integrating limit orders through one-sided liquidity<sup>8</sup>. 

With these integrations, AMMs are becoming more flexible similar to traditional order book markets while retaining their decentralised nature and opitmising fee sharing possibilities. 

## **Personal Thoughts and Recommendations**
As the most popular AMM on BSC, I personally recommend PCS to follow many of Uniswap's latest innovations as they are truly revolutionising the AMM landscape. However, since the Uniswap's latest update is under a closed license for 2 years to remain competitive<sup>8</sup>, it may also be beneficial for PCS to focus on other innovations in P2E games, NFTs and other marketplace enhancements such as an NFT marketplace. 

Personally, I believe the next goldmine is in P2E games and NFTs. Leading the growth of this industry is definitely Axie Infinity (AXS), but I believe smaller less well known games such as Splinterlands which focuses more on gameplay than economics, will be the next to grow. 

By targeting this niche, PCS can grow and ensure they are moving forward with innovations, while maximising their resources and taking advantage of work already done by Uniswap once they open source their code. 

# Glossary
<a name="1"></a> **Fair Launch**: a new token distribution method with no team allocation, no ICO and no presale. Users can earn the new token through actively participating in the protocols. 

<a name="4"></a> **Liquidity Pools (LPs)**: tokens provided by users that other traders can trade between. Traditionally, the LP will always contain 50% of each asset in the trading pair (though newer AMMs allow one-sided liquidity)

<a name="2"></a> **Yield Farming**: earning the native tokens of AMMs through providing liquidity to the liquidity pools as an added incentive


<a name="3"></a> **Staking**: committing tokens (often includes an unstaking period, but not always) to earn other tokens or more of the same token to increase utility of the base token

<a name="5"></a> **Rugpull**: a type of exit scam typically involving pulling out all liquidity from the LP (thus holders can no longer sell), or simply selling all of the team's token into the LP and depreciating the price significantly. [Here](https://www.cylynx.io/blog/the-rise-of-cryptocurrency-exit-scams-and-defi-rug-pulls/) is a more detailed explanation and a few famous examples.
